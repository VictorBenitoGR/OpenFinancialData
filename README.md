The intelligent collection, cleaning, processing and visualization of data is an indispensable process for the efficient, precise, productive and sharp **self-criticism** of any project. 

This project seeks to facilitate the accounting records and financial analysis of companies, which includes the generation of financial statements and their forecasts based on different models, such as simple average, moving average, exponential smoothing, and so on. A mechanism will be developed to analyze and visualize the evolution of companies listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange using their public financial statements with a conversion from XBRL format to an R dataframe.

## Background
This project started as a personal initiative during my university career at Tecnológico de Monterrey (ITESM), who has agreements with several companies to facilitate students the development of projects attacking the specific problems they have (in this case Herdez Group with public data & L'Oréal Paris Mexico with private data).
